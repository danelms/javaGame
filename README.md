## Instructions
### Game
When playing on the same machine (select "Local Multiplayer" in the main menu to launch) player one controls their car using the W, A, S and D keys. Player two controls their car using the up, down, left and right arrow keys.  

When playing across the (local) network (select "Network Multiplayer" in the main menu to launch) enter the IP address of the server instance you wish to connect with. Once two players have joined, the game will commence. Each player controls their car with the W, A, S and D keys.
### ServerWindow
The server window will display its IP address. Simply click the "Launch Server" button to create a session that 2 players can join. Once the session ends, the ports and window will automatically close.
